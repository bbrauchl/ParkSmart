Hosting location for code related to the Park Smart camera system

The goal of this project was to create a system that could monitor a parking lot and report the locations of vacent parking spaces to end users, and store the data for any other use.

This codebase is the web application for parksmart, including a build for the custom webapi's and the reactjs frontend applicaion for the project, as well as a few access scripts and setup scripts for the MySQL database.
